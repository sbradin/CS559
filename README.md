# 8Queens Game:

### <b>How To Play:</b>
Player and Computer take turns placing queens on a standard chess board.

The goal of the game is to cut off as many possible moves for your opponent. If there are no available tiles for the current player to place a queen, the player who placed the last queen wins.

An acceptable location to place a queen is described by a tile that is not being attacked by your own nor your opponents placed queens. 

The game starts with an initial randomly placed queen from the computer for variability in possible game boards played. A player simply clicks the square they wish to place a queen at and the computer will promptly respond.

### <b>Options</b>
The player has the option of Easy or Hard mode in the menu screen, as well as the option to show potential remaining safe moves.

#### <b>Note: the option to show potential moves is highly encouraged for seeing potential strategies when learning to play. Removing this option can also be considered as a Harder Mode for an extra challenge.</b>
